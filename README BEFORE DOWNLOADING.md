# minesweeper-text
Basically what the title says
Pretty self-explainatory stuff

!! THIS BRANCH CONTAINS THE BARE MINIMUM !!

	You should be able to edit and compile using Code::Blocks, but not Visual Studio 2019
	For that, there is the visual_studio branch
	It holds a mindless dump of the entire VS 2019 minesweeper-text directory (so idk if this can work on another machine)

TL;DR : This may be edited via Code::Blocks, but not with VS 2019. Using the visual_studio MIGHT work on VS 2019 tho

OH ! By the way !
A Google Minesweeper-like functionnality is implemented !
In Google, if you RIGHT CLICK + LEFT CLICK on a, say, 3 that has 3 flags around it, it will reveal the rest of the cells.
Diging a numbered cell with enough flags does the same in this game too ! :D
